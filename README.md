🎬 LSTM Movie Review Sentiment Analysis 🍿
Welcome to LSTM Movie Review Sentiment Analysis! This project uses Deep Learning (LSTM) to read movie reviews and guess if they're Positive 😊 or Negative 😡.

🚀 What This Project Does
🧠 We trained an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model using the IMDB movie reviews dataset.
📖 It learns from thousands of reviews and becomes smart enough to tell if a review is happy or sad.

🧰 Tech Stack :

🐍 Python

🤖 TensorFlow & Keras

🧹 NLTK (text cleaning)

📊 Pandas & NumPy

📚 IMDB Dataset (50,000 reviews!)

🔧 How It Works :

📂 Load the IMDB dataset

🧽 Clean the text (remove HTML, stopwords, etc.)

✏️ Tokenize and pad the text

🏗️ Build an LSTM model to learn from reviews

🧪 Test the model on new reviews

💬 Type your own movie review — it tells you the sentiment!
